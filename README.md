#Video Game Prices Shiny App

##Welcome to my shiny app! *sparkles* 

I have chosen Option B for Assignment B-3 for STAT545B at UBC and created my own shiny app!

This app lets you examine the average original price of different video game genres published in different languages. 

I have used the steam_games data set from datateachr for this app. You can access the original data by simply loading library(datateachr) in R!

Here is a link to a running instance of the app: https://jade-r.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-jade-r/
