# Video Game Prices Shiny App

## Welcome to my shiny app! :sparkles:

I have chosen Option C for Assignment B-4 for STAT545B at UBC and implemented additional features and improvements to the shiny app that I created in Assignment B-3. 

This app lets you examine the average original price of different video game genres published in different languages. 

I have used the steam_games data set from datateachr for this app. You can access the original data by simply loading library(datateachr) in R!

Here is a link to a running instance of the app: https://jade-r.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-jade-r/



*Side note to instructor/TAs: I deployed the updated version of my app before I realized I should have made a separate app so that you could compare the updates. Hopefully comparing my code from Assignment B3 to Assignment B4 is enough to see all the changes I made!*
